Do the Histograms look the same?
- Yes.
Why, and should they?
- The two histograms look almost identical because of the way we average data to create =sumofrows=.
  =data= begins as a matrix with 100,000 rows and 10 columns. =sumofrows= averages each row to find the marginal distribution, resulting in a 100,000 element vector.
  When we create =data2=, we are making a vector of 100,000 elements that follows the same probability of success as =data=, and by finding the marginal distribution of =data=, we have ensured that it maintains the same general probability.
  This means that =sumofrows= and =data2= should be nearly identical from a general perspective.

  --> We're essentially "averaging" =data= so that it will maintain the same slope/shape, but have fewer elements. 

* Part B

Summary(tr)
| mode    | FALSE |  TRUE |
| logical | 10027 | 89973 |

Calcualated probability of first success on first trial:
$0.9^{1}=0.9$

Summary(tr2)
| mode    | FALSE | TRUE |
| logical | 90949 | 9051 |

Calculated probability of first success on second trial:
$\binom{1}{0}*0.9^{1}*0.1^{1}=0.09$

Explanation of data summaries:

As explained in the lab document, =tr= finds every instance of 1 in the first column, registering =1= as a logical =true= and =0= as =false=. =tr2= finds every instance of 0 in the first column, then given that, every instance of =1= in the second column where the first column is 0.

This gives us likelihood of the first success on first trial (=tr=) and likelihood of first success on second trial (=tr2=).
When we calculate the mathematical probability of sucess on first trial, we get $0.9$, which is similar to what we got from our R code (Since $\frac{89973}{89973+10027}=0.8997$).

Similarly, when we calculate the mathematical likelihood of first success on second trial, we get $0.09$, which is also similar to what we got from our R code (since $\frac{9051}{9051+90949}=0.09053$)
