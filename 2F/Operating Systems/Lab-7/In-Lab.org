Moby Duck Lyrics

by The Longest Johns


[Verse 1]
[Verse 1]
After fourteen years I left the sea, for a life upon a lake
After fourteen years I left the sea, for a life upon a lake
After all theâ€…stormsâ€…I'd seen, Iâ€…needed a good break
After all theâ€…stormsâ€…I'd seen, Iâ€…needed a good break
I thought stillâ€…waters would mean peace for me
I thought stillâ€…waters would mean peace for me
But that was a mistake
But that was a mistake
For the place I chose was bedeviled by a giant evil drake
For the place I chose was bedeviled by a giant evil drake


[Verse 2]
[Verse 2]
A mallard of such malice, twice the size of any man
A mallard of such malice, twice the size of any man
A bill to give you nightmares and a monstrous wingspan
A bill to give you nightmares and a monstrous wingspan
You cannot hope to fight it so avoid him if you can
You cannot hope to fight it so avoid him if you can
That terrifying waterfowl, the beast beyond the dam
That terrifying waterfowl, the beast beyond the dam

We'll win the day and do away the dreaded Moby Duck
We'll win the day and do away the dreaded Moby Duck


[Verse 3]
[Verse 3]
I'm not one for surrender so a vengeful oath I swore
I'm not one for surrender so a vengeful oath I swore
I gathered up me hearties like so many times before
I gathered up me hearties like so many times before
We shot our ship with weapons and prepared to go to war
We shot our ship with weapons and prepared to go to war
'Til the fetid feathered fearsome flying duck will breathe no more
'Til the fetid feathered fearsome flying duck will breathe no more

[Verse 4]
[Verse 4]
There was bonnie brave Marie, who to her arms had waved goodbye
There was bonnie brave Marie, who to her arms had waved goodbye
And handsome Jack whose duck-attack left him without an eye
And handsome Jack whose duck-attack left him without an eye
The Derby twins with one leg each on deck were standing by
The Derby twins with one leg each on deck were standing by
Only a couple dozen limbs between a crew of twenty-five
Only a couple dozen limbs between a crew of twenty-five

The fight raged on for several hours, defend and then attack
The fight raged on for several hours, defend and then attack
With beatings from those wicked wings our boat began to crack

**Running serial program with 3 inputs**

The serial process slows down when multiple files are intoduced, the total execution file decreasing by 0.008 seconds - which seems appreciable for this situation. Adding a 4th file slows the process down an additional 0.008 seconds, and up to 6 can slow it down as much as 0.033 seconds.

In general, the parallel program appears to handle large numbers of inputs better. 
* Part 10
Running each of these commands and redirecting to /dev/null gives me an average time thats anywhere from 0.001 to 0.004 seconds slower than running these commands regularly. This tells me that it probably isn't I/O operations limiting the speed of the program, but might rather the actual computations that the program has to perform.
