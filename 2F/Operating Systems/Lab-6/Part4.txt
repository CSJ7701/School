After fourteen years I left the sea, for a life upon a lake
After all the√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä¶storms√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä¶I'd seen, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä¶needed a good break

After all the√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä¶storms√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä¶I'd seen, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä¶needed a good break
I thought still√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä¶waters would mean peace for me

em rof ecaep naem dluow sretaw¶Ä‚¨Ç‚¢√llits thguoht I
I thought still√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä¶waters would mean peace for me
But that was a mistake
ekatsim a saw taht tuB
ekatsim a saw taht tuB
But that was a mistake
For the place I chose was bedeviled by a giant evil drake
ekard live tnaig a yb delivedeb saw esohc I ecalp eht roF
ekard live tnaig a yb delivedeb saw esohc I ecalp eht roF
For the place I chose was bedeviled by a giant evil drake
