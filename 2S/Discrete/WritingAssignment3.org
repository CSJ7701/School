* *Division Algorithm*
** *Showing the Form of Square of Odd Integers*
Using the Division Algorithm, we can express any odd integer as $\(2k+1\)$ for some integer $\(k\)$. The square of any odd integer can be represented as $\((2k+1)^2\)$. Expanding this expression, we get: $(2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k^2 + k) + 1$.
Since $\(k^2 + k\)$ is an integer, we can denote it as $\(m\)$, where $\(m \in \mathbb{Z}\)$. Therefore, the square of any odd integer is of the form $\(8m + 1\)$ for some $\(m \in \mathbb{Z}\)$.
** *Definition of Greatest Common Divisor (gcd)*
According to the textbook (section 4.2), the greatest common divisor $\( \text{gcd}(a, b) \)$ for any pair of positive integers $\(a\)$ and $\(b\)$ is defined as:$\newline\newline$
$g$, iff $g$ is the largest common divisor of $a$ and $b$; that is, iff:$\newline$
1. $g | a,g | b$, and
2. if $c$ is any integer such that $c|a$ and $c|b$, then $c\le g$.
** *Finding gcd(345, 92)*
$\text{gcd}(345, 92) = 345m+92n$ $\newline$
Step 1: Apply the Division Algorithm to find quotients and remainders:
   - \(345 = 92 \times 3 + 69\)
   - \(92 = 69 \times 1 + 23\)
   - \(69 = 23 \times 3 + 0\)
Step 2: Identify the last non-zero remainder, which is \(23\).$\newline$
Step 3: Express each remainder as a linear combination of the original numbers:
   - \(23 = 92 - 69 \times 1\)
   - \(69 = 345 - 92 \times 3\)
Step 4: Substitute the expressions for remainders into each other:
   - \(23 = 92 - (345 - 92 \times 3) \times 1\)
   - Simplify: \(23 = 92 - 345 + 92 \times 3\)
   - Simplify further: \(23 = 345 \times (-1) + 92 \times 4\)
Step 5: Hence, \( \text{gcd}(345, 92) = 23 = 345 \times (-1) + 92 \times 4\), where \(m = -1\) and \(n = 4\).
* *Exploration of Congruence Classes*

** *Interpretation of Congruence Statement*
For $\(n > 1, n \in \mathbb{Z}\)$, the statement $\(a \equiv b \mod n\)$ means that $\(a\)$ and $\(b\)$ have the same remainder when divided by $\(n\)$.

** *Verification of Congruence and Finding Other Members*
We verify \(4 \equiv -7 \mod 11\) by observing that \(4 - (-7) = 11\), which is divisible by \(11\). Other positive members of the congruence class \(4\) can be found by adding multiples of \(11\), such as \(15\) and \(26\).

** *Partitioning Z into Congruence Classes*
The relation "congruence mod \(n\)" for \(n > 1, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) partitions \(\mathbb{Z}\) into \(n\) classes, each containing integers with the same remainder when divided by \(n\). Thus, it is an equivalence relation on \(\mathbb{Z}\).$\newpage$
*Explanation*:
  - Consider any integer \(a\) in \(\mathbb{Z}\).
  - When \(a\) is divided by \(n\), it yields a remainder $r\ |\ 0 \leq r < n$.
  - There are \(n\) possible remainders: \(0, 1, 2, ..., n-1\).
  - Each integer \(a\) belongs to the congruence class represented by its remainder \(r\).
  - Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\) is partitioned into \(n\) congruence classes, each containing integers congruent to each other modulo \(n\).

- **Example**: 
  - For \(n = 4\), the congruence classes are: 
    - Class 0: \(\{...,-8, -4, 0, 4, 8, ...\}\)
    - Class 1: \(\{...,-7, -3, 1, 5, 9, ...\}\)
    - Class 2: \(\{...,-6, -2, 2, 6, 10, ...\}\)
    - Class 3: \(\{...,-5, -1, 3, 7, 11, ...\}\)

** *Explanation of Remainder Classes*
For any \(n > 1, n \in \mathbb{Z}\), there are exactly \(n\) remainder classes. This is because when dividing any integer \(a\) by \(n\), we obtain a remainder \(r\) where \(0 \leq r < n\). Thus, there are \(n\) possible remainders, forming \(n\) remainder classes.
Remainder classes for an arbitrary \(n\) are: \(0, 1, 2, ..., n-1\).
