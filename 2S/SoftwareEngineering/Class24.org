* Compile and run instructions

No compilation needed.
Simply navigate to the file's directory, and run the command =python Class24=.
If this does not work or throws an error, you may need to rename the file to =Class24.py=, then run the command =python Class24.py=, since D2L does not allow me to submit files with a =*.py= extension.
