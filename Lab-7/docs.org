* NAME
  homework - Process and print the contents of a file line by line.

* SYNOPSIS
  **homework** [OPTIONS] File

* DESCRIPTION

* OPTIONS
  -h
    Display this help message.

  -r
    Reverse each line before printing.

  -d [delay]
    Specify a delay in seconds or fractions thereof. For example, -d 0.5 introduces a 500 milliseconds delay.

  -H
    Print an HTTP response header (for use with web servers).

  -p
    Process input files in parallel.

  -L [logfile]
    Log the status of the program to a specified logfile.

* EXAMPLES
  Process a file in reverse with a 1-second delay:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash

  #+END_SRC

  Process a file in parallel with logging:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  homework -p -L logfile.txt file1.txt file2.txt
  #+END_SRC
